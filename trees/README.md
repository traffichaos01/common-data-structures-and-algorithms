# Trees

O(N) ST for storing tree and traversing

Full Tree is when every node has no children or k chidren

## Binary Tree
Balanced Binary Tree traversal: O(log(n)) as you are eliminating half of the input at every step of the way.

## Complete Binary Tree
Almost perfect,
all nodes have two children or no children (leaf).

All leaf nodes without children fill from left of tree, no standalone leaf that isnt on left side

## Full Binary tree
all nodes have two children or no children (leaf).

## Balanced Binary Tree
Left and right sub trees whose heights differ by no more than 1.

## Binary Search Tree
BST property, every node to the left must be strictly less than the current node value.
This means subtrees to the left all have values less than current node.
Duplicates go on the right, as well as greater numbers
Ask about duplicate values.

## Perfect binary Tree
Interior Nodes all have two child nodes, lead nodes all have the same depth.

## What is a branch
A trajectory down a tree to a leaf node.

## Branch Sums DFS
O(N) time, O(N) space for worst case
